### What is the difference between .map, .every, and .forEach?

- .map()
> returns a new Array of objects created by taking some action on the original item.

- .every()
> returns a boolean - true if every element in this array satisfies the provided testing function. An important difference with .every() is that the test function may not always be called for every element in the array. Once the testing function returns false for any element, no more array elements are iterated. Therefore, the testing function should usually have no side effects.

- .forEach()
>returns nothing - It iterates the Array performing a given action for each item in the Array.

### the test about Immutable.js

> It is not a very good way to add Immutable.js into a part of project.

- redux-immutable
> Firstly, set something following the api in github [redux-immutable](https://github.com/gajus/redux-immutable).
After that I find that it is a hard task to change my existing project with immutable.js. Because the state is not an Object. The new state is a Map of Imuutable. Finally I change the `connect` function as following code.

```
import {connect} from 'react-redux';

export default function _connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps, mergeProps, options) {
    let _mstp = function(state) {
        const _state = state.toJS()
        return mapStateToProps(_state)
    }
    return connect(_mstp,mapDispatchToProps,mergeProps,options)
}

```
